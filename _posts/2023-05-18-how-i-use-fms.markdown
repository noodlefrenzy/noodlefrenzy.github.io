I've been writing a series of posts on LinkedIn on how I use Foundation Models in my daily life. This differs from how I use them with our customers and how we integrate them into projects. I may do future writings on that, but initially I wanted to focus on helping my friends and colleagues understand how powerful these models are as tools for helping them in their daily lives, right now.
